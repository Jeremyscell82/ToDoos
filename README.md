# ToDoos
During these safer at home times.... I decided to build a server, then I built an app to talk to it...

ToDoos is a very simple Todo app that allows you to pick your endpoint, create users, and enter todoos (Server IP)..



Follow these simple instructions and create your own server

Before going to part two... create a todo model, matching the todoo model in the app and wala, you now have your own todo app running off your own server....because why not.
